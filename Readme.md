# How to check whether the series with the different view types are compatible


<p>This example illustrate how to check compatibility of the series with the different view types at runtime. Basically, types of the series to be combined should use the same Diagram<br />
type. So, to check whether series types are compatible, you can simply compare their Diagram types. To accomplish this task, create a new ChartControl instance when the series of the desired type is created, and then compare whether it has the same diagram type as an existing one.</p>
